    <h2 class="w3-text-light-grey">Gaming experience with eye-tracking technology using View Point System glasses</h2>
    <hr style="width:200px" class="w3-opacity">
    <p>
<h3>Introduction:</h3><br><br>
In the following experiment I was researching what can be done, what could be improved and what help does the eye tracking system provide in the gaming industry. There are multiple ways to show or preview a game and few of the biggest perspectives are; first person perspective(FPP), third person perspective(TPP), top-down perspective(TDP), isometric, flat or side-view, text-based. Each perspective has something different and allow the player to emerge in a different way into the game. My research mainly involve the first person perspective. This perspective allow the player to see through the character eyes and have a complete experience of playing compared with a top down perspective. <br><br>

Most popular games that use the first person perspective are 3D shooters, but there are also other titles such as Electronic Arts' Medal of Honor: Allied Assault, Fox Interactive's No One Lives Forever series, or id Software's DOOM III. Although, as a support for my research I choose Elder Scrolls Online which was developed by Bethesda. This game is categorized as a Massively Multiplayer Online Role Play Game (MMO RPG), which has two different point of views. One is of course first person perspective and the other is the third person perspective. This will allow me to do the difference between the two and see which one is fit for the player better experience.

<br><br>

<h3>Equipment used:</h3><br><br>
This project was realized with the help of View Point System 16 glasses and the editing program Filmora. With the glasses, I recorded the gameplay and the post processing was made in Filmora, such as detail edit and sound. While I was recording with the glasses, I also recorded the in-game footage with Twitch Studio, to have a better view of what was happening in the game.

<br><br>

<h3>In-game footage/ In-game discussion:</h3><br><br>
I played this game for over 500 hours in the course of 5 years or something like that. After my experience with the game, I decided to do the research with it. 
In the first part of the video, I am waiting in the loading screen and not much eye movement is occurred. As soon as I load into the game my focus, point is on the character from the third person perspective. After moving around a bit, I zoom out the camera at the maxim point and look around at the environment. <br><br>

Zooming back in at the maximum gives you the first person perspective that I'm going to pay attention and talk about. When I am in the first person perspective, we can see quote on quote through the character eyes. With the help of editing I overlapped, the footage took with the eye tracking glasses and the in-game footage. Then I went ahead and played the game doing the most common things, gathering resources and fighting monsters. In the first encounter with a monster, my focus point was stable because I knew the game so it was not necessary to look around too much. <br><br>

Generally, in combat, you focus on the enemy but there are moments when you look around for advantages. After a while in first person perspective, I swapped to third person perspective to be able to see which one could be more entertaining for the player itself. In addition, I noticed that most of the time I spend looking in my monitor is watching my character and not really looking around enjoying the game. Fast-forward after some repetitive sequences I opened the inventory. Inventory is not exactly made for first person perspective. It opens an interface with the items you own and other stats. <br><br>

On this part games could improve by making the character look into a bag as a transition then open an interface top-down perspective and give that feeling that the character looks into the bag. However, this might cause problems with the coding and implementations of third person. Could be possible but it is a lot of work that many game developers chose not to do. In addition, another point I want to make is that the camera from first person perspective in games is mainly situated around the chest of your character. In this game, it seems to be above the neck or around the neck of the character. Which adds a bit more reality to the game. 

<br><br>

<h3>Improvements in games through eye tracking:</h3><br><br>
How is eye tracking going to improve the games? One of the main improvements that game industry is looking for mostly involve the fully emerge of the player into the game universe which is through the Virtual reality. Sure, this is a costly transition and now the gaming biggest companies are just releasing titles for the money not necessary improving. They are focused on improving the graphics that over the years are closer to photorealism. Slowly as the technology progress and the materials for producing such equipment's such as virtual reality glasses, the gaming industry will have a big switch into that realizing small indie companies are taking away their fan base. I personally think that it is possible to advance to the next generation of gaming, but this will require a lot of research into the domain of game engines and eye tracking.

<br><br>

<h3>Conclusions:</h3><br><br>
One of the main conclusions is that the game as they are now are improving but by just a bit. It is a long process to incorporate accurate eye tracking and even virtual reality into gaming. At the end of the day, the game company take the decision to do the switch or remain on the screens. 
On the other hand related to only eye tracking, is that they play a big role into the gaming experience someone has. Sure, some games or companies failed to incorporate the perspective into their games, but with trial and error, they make progress. <br><br>

Combining multiple perspective in a single game might sound good, but it is better to focus on one. As an example first person shooter games, most of them only have first person perspective in which can be used eye tracking to experience the motion and character movements.
Finally yet importantly, I think that using eye tracking more in the gaming industry could attract more people into the gaming scene. Right now, the average age of a gamer is 34 years old, 70% of gamers are age 18 or older and 70% of parents believe video games have a positive influence on their children's lives. All those numbers could increase even if slightly with some changes in the gaming industry.
